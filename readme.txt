Library Management System

A prebuilt and compiled runnable version of this application can be found in the LibraryManagementSystem.jar file.
Download and run this file to have full access to the application. There is no need to compile or build from source. No installation required!
The application can be run from any OS that has a JRE and Microsoft SQL Server. We reccomend the most recent stable release of these. 
All other libraries are already built into the application file.

To run this file you will need Microsoft SQL Server installed on your system. You can find this at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx

You will also need a Java Runtime Environment, otherwise known as a JRE. This can be found at https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

The application is built in Java, so to edit the source code you will need a JDK that can be found at the same link as the JRE.
