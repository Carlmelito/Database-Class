Library Management System

A prebuilt and compiled runnable version of this application can be found in the LibraryManagementSystem.jar file.
Download and run this file to have full access to the application. There is no need to compile or build from source. No installation required!
The application can be run from any OS that has a JRE and Microsoft SQL Server. We reccomend the most recent stable release of these. 
All other libraries are already built into the application file.

To run this file you will need Microsoft SQL Server installed on your system. You can find this at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx

You will also need a Java Runtime Environment, otherwise known as a JRE. This can be found at https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

However if you wish to build the project you will need maven which can be found at https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

You will also need an JDK to be able to compile the code. This can be found at the same link as the JRE.

After you have these, you can navigate into the repository folder and run 'mvn package'
then navigate into the target folder. There will be a DatabaseProject-2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file. Run this executable file.
